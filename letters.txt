Dear \textbf{[Hiring Manager’s Name]},

\vspace{0.3cm}

I am excited to apply for the \textbf{Backend Developer} position at [Company Name]. With several years of professional experience in Java and Spring Boot, I have designed and built backend systems that power both internal enterprise applications and government projects. My work focuses on creating clean, maintainable, and scalable code that other teams can rely on.

At Cam Info Services, I developed RESTful APIs, optimized databases using MySQL and PostgreSQL, and implemented Spring Data JPA and Hibernate to streamline data access. I collaborated closely with frontend and mobile teams, ensuring smooth integrations and strong API contracts. Additionally, I contributed to critical systems such as Cambodia’s COVID-19 Information System and multiple enterprise platforms, applying caching, asynchronous processing, and secure backend design to meet high-demand use cases.

I am particularly drawn to [Company Name] because of [specific reason — e.g., its mission, products, engineering culture, or technical challenges]. I am eager to apply my experience in Spring Boot, microservices, and backend architecture to deliver reliable and efficient solutions that make a real impact.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my skills, experience, and collaborative approach to your team. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to [Company Name].
