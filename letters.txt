Dear \textbf{[Hiring Manager’s Name]},

\vspace{0.3cm}

I’m excited to apply for the \textbf{Backend Developer} position at [Company Name]. With several years of professional experience in Java and Spring Boot, I’ve designed and built backend systems that power real-world applications for internal and government use. My focus has always been on writing clean, maintainable code that’s scalable and reliable.

At Cam Info Services, I worked on developing RESTful APIs, integrating Spring Data JPA with MySQL and PostgreSQL, and optimizing backend performance for critical systems. I collaborated closely with frontend and mobile teams to ensure smooth integration and a strong API contract. My work often involves turning complex business rules into simple, stable backend services that other teams can confidently build upon.

I’m particularly drawn to [Company Name] because of [specific reason — e.g., its mission, products, engineering culture, or technical challenges]. I value building systems that make an impact, and I see a strong match between your goals and my experience with Spring Boot, microservices, security, and modern backend best practices.

I’d welcome the chance to bring my backend development skills and collaborative mindset to your team. Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to [Company Name].

Sincerely,\\[3cm]
